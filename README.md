capybara-screenshot gem
=======================

Using this gem, whenever a [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara) test in [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/), [Rspec](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec) or Minitest  fails, the HTML for the failed page and a screenshot (when using [capybara-webkit](https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit), [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) or [poltergeist](https://github.com/jonleighton/poltergeist)) is saved into $APPLICATION_ROOT/tmp/capybara.

This is a huge help when trying to diagnose a problem in your failing steps as you can view the source code and potentially how the page looked at the time of the failure.

Usage
-----

    gem install capybara-screenshot

or update your Gemfile to include `capybara-screenshot` at the bottom (order respected as of Bundler 0.10):

    gem 'capybara-screenshot', :group => :test

If you require more control, you can generate the screenshot on demand rather than on failure. This is useful
if the failure occurs at a point where the screen shot is not as useful for debugging a rendering problem. This
can be more useful if you disable the auto-generate on failure feature with the following config

	Capybara::Screenshot.autosave_on_failure = false

Anywhere the Capybara DSL methods (visit, click etc.) are available so too will are the screenshot methods.

	screenshot_and_save_page

Or for screenshot only, which will automatically open the image.

	screenshot_and_open_image

These are just calls on the main library methods.

	Capybara::Screenshot.screenshot_and_save_page

	Capybara::Screenshot.screenshot_and_open_image


Driver configuration
--------------------

The gem supports the default rendering method for Capybara to generate the screenshot, which is:

	page.driver.render(path)

There are also some specific driver configurations for Selenium, Webkit, and Poltergeist. See [https://github.com/mattheworiordan/capybara-screenshot/blob/master/lib/capybara-screenshot.rb](the definitions here). The Rack::Test driver, Rails' default, does not allow
rendering, so it has a driver definition as a noop.

If a driver is not found the default rendering will be used. If this doesn't work with your driver, then you can
add another driver configuration like so

	# The driver name should match the Capybara driver config name.
	Capybara::Screenshot.register_driver(:exotic_browser_driver) do |driver, path|
	  driver.super_dooper_render(path)
	end


Custom screenshot filename
--------------------------

If you want to control the screenshot filename for a specific test libarary, to inject the test name into it for example,
you can override how the basename is generated for the file like so

	Capybara::Screenshot.register_filename_prefix_formatter(:rspec) do |example|
	    "screenshot-#{example.description.gsub(' ', '-')}"
	  end
	end


Example application
-------------------

A simple Rails 3.1 example application has been set up at [https://github.com/mattheworiordan/capybara-screenshot-test-rails-3.1](https://github.com/mattheworiordan/capybara-screenshot-test-rails-3.1)
Git clone the app, and then run Cucumber `rake cucumber`, RSpec `rspec spec/**/*_spec.rb` and Minitest `rake test` and expect intentional failures.
Now check the $APPLICATION_ROOT/tmp/capybara folder for the automatic screen shots generated from failed tests.

Common problems
---------------

If you find that screen shots are not automatically being generated, then it's possible the `capybara-screenshot` gem is loading before your testing framework is loading, and thus unable to determine which framework to hook into.  Make sure you include `capybara-screenshot` gem last in your Gemfile (order is respected by Bundler as of 0.10).  Alternatively, manually require `capybara-screenshot` using one of the following based on your framework:

    require 'capybara-screenshot/cucumber' # For Cucumber support
    require 'capybara-screenshot/rspec' # For RSpec support
    require 'capybara-screenshot/minitest' # For MiniSpec support

[Raise an issue on the Capybara-Screenshot issue tracker](https://github.com/mattheworiordan/capybara-screenshot/issues) if you are still having problems.
